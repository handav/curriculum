## Introduction / Essential Questions
Subjective data exists on the periphery of the current machine learning landscape. Subjective data means the deconstruction of how we work with data in machine learning. This means exploring several areas that are taken for granted: how we collect data, the taxonomies we use, the models that are eventually created using machine learning algorithms, the subjectivity and biases in existing datasets, how we can model data responsibly, how to use datasets as an artistic medium, and how to talk about and address bias retention in datasets over time. 

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This workshop is designed for anyone interested in critically examining datasets, but would be most appropriate for ages 16+. 

### Pacing / Duration
Generally, this workshop will take 2-3 hours. This workshop also requires that students fill out two surveys ahead of time (adjustable to your preference):
1) Asking students to label 5-6 images with the emotions they evoke (I used images from the game Dixit, but these can be any images)
2) Asking students to submit a piece of emotional text and the reason they feel that way.

- Break down of the class schedule example: 
  - 1:00 Overview of data, bias in data, examining subjectivity 
  - :15 break
  - :30 Exercise in creative taxonomies and classification
  - :15 Wrap-up discussion & sharing taxonomies, questions

### Materials
Teachers will need a computer with prepared material, and the student answers from the two surveys.

## Outcomes & Goals
After this workshop, students will...
* Understand where data and labels come from
* Be able to talk about issues in data collection
* Be aware of and able to critically think about bias in datasets 
* Understand how datasets can be created for artistic purposes
* Be able to talk about and create their own taxonomies
* Learn about specific researchers to follow and research being done in bias

## Exercise Descriptions

#### This workshop contains three parts.

### 1) Discussion and Slides/Information

Slides can be found at [https://drive.google.com/open?id=117x4LZx_OxD65nuQVGpLtGoi-kP-lkDY](https://drive.google.com/open?id=117x4LZx_OxD65nuQVGpLtGoi-kP-lkDY). These slides are available with attribution only.

Subjective data encompasses several facets: 
- Emotions and other subjective experiences: How do we incorporate these into AI, especially as AI starts moving towards more complex and personal areas? How can we capture abstractions like emotions in datasets, and how can we model things like personality and life experience?
- Identifying subjectivity in "objective" datasets: If we examine commonly used machine learning datasets, what types of subjectivity do we find, especially when we look at how the datasets were created, what the motivations and demographics of the taggers are (if taggers are present), where the data comes from (if not manually tagged), who funded the dataset, what the dataset leaves out, where the dataset breaks down, etc.?
- "Artisanal data": In the current AI landscape, particularly related to art, it is possible to create and use explicitly subjective datasets for artistic purposes with no claims to objectivity/completeness/usefulness. (This, to me, is interesting and positive).
- Bias retention over time: A culture's current set of values is a type of bias and is inherently present in datasets. How can we avoid bias retention over time, and is it possible to update datasets with newer values? 
- Labels and vocabulary: All the above issues require labels and vocabulary to talk about them more concretely. How can we create these and use them with regularity? 

### 2) Creative Taxonomies

In this stage, students will classify the text snippets from survey #2 using their own taxonomies. They can get as creative as they want - no limitations should be given. 

### 3) Recap and Sharing Taxonomies

Students should go around and share their classifications of the text. Afterwards, a link should be provided so that they can see the reasons why the students chose their text snippet.
